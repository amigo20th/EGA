# EGA
implementation of Eclectic Genetic Algorithm in Python.

This code contains the implementation of a type of genetic algorithm, it is EGA[1].
Since an aptitude function has a linear equation, it has 2 equations with 2 variables.
Only in this way does it work because with more equations and more variables it does not converge in a short time.
